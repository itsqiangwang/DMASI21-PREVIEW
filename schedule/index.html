        content="The Department of Design Media Arts (DMA) at UCLA is one of the nation’s top design departments offering a comprehensive, multidisciplinary education in media creation, which fosters individual exploration and innovative thinking. Geared specifically for high school students, the department offers the DMA Summer Institute, a two-week program with morning and afternoon classes introducing design practices in the contexts of print, net, worlds, and video. The program is taught by professionally trained and experienced instructors using the most current software and technology. It culminates in a final exhibition and the creation of a portfolio-ready body of work that students may include in their college applications in related fields. It also provides students with a rare opportunity to sample college life in a cutting-edge design department, while earning four units of pass/no pass UC credit.">

                    then give a short presentation on applying to Arts programs at UCLA.
